# My Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock solution

This is my solution to the BONUS version of [Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I did this challenge with the free subscription so I did NOT have the Figma file. I used a browser extension called Pixel Perfect Pro to superimpose the design images over the site to make a pixel perfect integration because I'm a details oriented person (nobody's perfect!)
> I built the BONUS challenge version of this game with Lizard and Spock which is harder than the original version.

## Thoughts process

### Step 1: Quick look at the designs

I checked the desktop and mobile designs and decided that the structure would allow me to approach integration as usual with a top-bottom approach and desktop-first.

I start from the top of the design and build each piece one by one until I reach the bottom... starting with the header.

### Step 2: The header

After putting the background gradient to the body I started with the header. A logo at the left and the score at the right, flexbox with space-between will do the job nicely.

I had to adjust the logo position and paddings in the header because they're not exactly the same and I do pixel perfect designs you know. So I throwed a `position: relative; top: 4px;` on the logo to fit perfectly the design.

Also I had to add a `h1` tag for best practices so I decided to put one that is invisible (because nothing on the design seems relevant to be a title). I didn't add `aria-hidden` attribute so that ARIA technologies can use this information. I'm not an expert on accessibility, I'm still learning so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

### Step 3: The buttons group

I started by adding the pentagon SVG image on the background of the div that will contain all buttons by using the `background-image` property. I centered everything according to the design using a combination of `margin-inline: auto` and `padding-block-start`. Nothing difficult here.

But then I looked further to the design and started wondering how the hell I'm gonna do these colored circles around each possible choice... with the shadows etc. and by the way they're NOT circles it would have been too easy right ðŸ¤£!

That's going to be a little challenge for me...

### Step 4: The GODAMN (NOT) CIRCLES buttons
