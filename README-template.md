## How I thought about developing this game

### First, the technologies

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties with Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow
- Google fonts

### Steps breakdown

## Step 1: Quick look at the designs

I checked the desktop and mobile designs and decided that the structure would allow me to approach integration as usual with a top-bottom approach and desktop-first.

I start from the top of the design and build each piece one by one until I reach the bottom... starting with the header.

## Step 2: The header

After putting the background gradient to the body I started with the header. A logo at the left and the score at the right, flexbox with space-between will do the job nicely.

I had to adjust the logo position and paddings in the header because they're not exactly the same and I do pixel perfect designs you know. So I throwed a `position: relative; top: 4px;` on the logo to fit perfectly the design.

Also I had to add a `h1` tag for best practices so I decided to put one that is invisible (because nothing on the design seems relevant to be a title). I didn't add `aria-hidden` attribute so that ARIA technologies can use this information. I'm not an expert on accessibility, I'm still learning so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
